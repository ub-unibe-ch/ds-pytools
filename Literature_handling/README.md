# ðŸŽ“ðŸ“š Literature Handling

Find and mine scholarly publication data and manage references with Python tools!

This folder contains tutorials to **access APIs** of notable providers and aggregators of **scholarly publication data**.

* **Crossref_API_basics**: Basic functionality of the [Crossref](https://www.crossref.org/) API using CrossrefCommons and Habanero
* **OpenAlex_API**: Introduction to the 5 endpoints of [OpenAlex](https://docs.openalex.org/) (works, authors, institutions, venues, concepts)

The tutorials are presented as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org).
We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The [miniconda](http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution provides a minimal Python and conda installation. A more comprehensive, but also larger distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes many well-known Python libraries for Data Science.

Additional installation instructions for Python libraries required by different tools can be found in the corresponding Jupyter notebooks.
