# Tools for image segmentation in the context of OCR

### table_segmentation_BZ  
The segmentation of tables in data fields is a crucial step 
in the process of data extraction from images. This Python 
Jupyter notebook displays image processing methods for the 
complete segmentation of a weather table in data fields.
In doing so, it provides insights into typical challenges and 
solution statements for image segmentation in the context of OCR.  

The file *weather_table.png* is an example of a weather table published in the *Bozner Wochenblatt* (later called *Bozner Zeitung*) (Source: [Landesbibliothek Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann](https://digital.tessmann.it), License: [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)).

### data_field_segmentation_BZ
The segmentation of data fields into images representing individual 
characters is an important prerequisite for machine-learning
based optical character recognition. This Python Jupyter notebook
displays some deterministic image processing steps required for
data field segmentation.  

The folder *segmentation_data_fields* contains some data field images obtained by table segmentation and data field extraction from weather tables published in the *Bozner Wochenblatt* (same source and licence as indicated above).
