# Tools for image segmentation in the context of OCR

### table_segmentation_BZ  
The segmentation of tables in data fields is a crucial step 
in the process of data extraction from images. This Python 
Jupyter notebook displays image processing methods for the 
complete segmentation of a weather table in data fields.
In doing so, it provides insights into typical challenges and 
solution statements for image segmentation in the context of OCR.

### data_field_segmentation_BZ
The segmentation of data fields into images representing individual 
characters is an important prerequisite for machine-learning
based optical character recognition. This Python Jupyter notebook
displays some deterministic image processing steps required for
data field segmentation.
