# Tools for template matching in the context of OCR

### table_extraction_BZ 
The extraction of objects such as tables from source images
such as digitized newspaper pages is an important preparatory
step in the process of data extraction from images. This
Python Jupyter notebook displays some methods required for 
object extraction based on template matching.  
The file *newspaper_page.png* is an example of a newspaper page published in the *Bozner Wochenblatt* (later called *Bozner Zeitung*) (Source: [Landesbibliothek Dr. Friedrich Te√ümann](https://digital.tessmann.it), License: [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)). The file *template.png* is a weather table extracted from another newspaper page from the same source (same licence) used as matching template.
