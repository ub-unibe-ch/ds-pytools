#  Python Digital Toolbox

simple tools for data handling and analysis in Python

	WORK IN PROGRESS

This repository contains examples of how to solve various data analysis problems using Python libraries.

The examples are presented as [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org), also accessible via [Binder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binder_Project) without local Python installation.

We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The [miniconda](http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) distribution provides a minimal Python and conda installation. A more comprehensive, but also larger distribution is [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which includes many well-known Python libraries for Data Science.

Additional installation instructions for Python libraries required by different tools can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.

Kindly brought to you by [University Library Bern](https://www.ub.unibe.ch/ub/index_eng.html).

## Background

This **Digital Toolbox** is a joint project of the [Digital Scholarship Support](https://www.digitalisierung.unibe.ch/projekte/digital_scholarship) (German) and Subject Specialists of the [Sciences Libraries](https://www.ub.unibe.ch/research/fachinformationen/portal_natural_sciences/index_eng.html).

**Digital Scholarship (DS)** - this term is used to describe the increasing use of new digital, data-driven methods in various branches of arts and humanities, social sciences and sciences. Researchers work on the basis of, with and on specific data sets and data structures, use data analysis, machine learning and big data technologies, and publish research results in new digital forms. With **Digital Scholarship Services** the University Library Bern actively supports these digital and data-driven methods in research and teaching.
